# IBM_QGSS2022

## Introudction 

In May 2022, I participated in Qiskit Global Summer School (https://qiskit.org/events/summer-school/). 
Watching all the lectures and working on four different labs has led me to continue my education in my quantum! 
It was my chance to learn more about IBM Qiskit and topics taught outside my undergraduate degree, such as quantum noises. 

I have provided a folder for the labs that I worked on!
